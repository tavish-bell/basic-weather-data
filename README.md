First data project! First time using an API for me as well. Pull down historical weather data (past two weeks) using tomorrow.io API and then use Pandas to present that data in a nice format.

Honestly, probably bit off way more than I should have for my first project in this arena. At this point, I don't have a full grasp of everything I did in this code, but that just means more opportunity to keep learning and refining my understanding.

So far, I'm really enjoying working with data. After I gain a bit more experience with the basics, I want to try my hand at some actual vizualization.
